    """(aka Batch, aka Swarm)
    A Workflow is a framework by which a user may define the relationship
    between tasks and define the relationship between multiple runs of the same
    set of tasks. The great benefit of the Workflow is that it's resumable.
    A Workflow can only be re-loaded if two things are shown to be exact
    matches to a previous Workflow:

    1. WorkflowArgs: It is recommended to pass a meaningful unique identifier
        to workflow_args, to ease resuming. However, if the Workflow is a
        one-off project, you may instantiate the Workflow anonymously, without
        WorkflowArgs. Under the hood, the WorkflowArgs will default to a UUID
        which, as it is randomly generated, will be harder to remember and thus
        harder to resume.

        Workflow args must be hashable. For example, CodCorrect or Como version
        might be passed as Args to the Workflow. For now, the assumption is
        WorkflowArgs is a string.

    2. The tasks added to the workflow. A Workflow is built up by
        using Workflow.add_task(). In order to resume a Workflow, all the same
        tasks must be added with the same dependencies between tasks.
