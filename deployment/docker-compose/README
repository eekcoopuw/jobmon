As of April 2022 his docker-compose config is not used.

Jobmon 2.0 and later is deployed using kubernetes, not by docker-compose.
These docker-compose files are work towards the "bare-metal" deployment of
Jobmon onto a person's laptop.

When the IHME Deployment repo is created this code will move to a similar distro-style repo.

These config files probably refer to code that no longer exists.
