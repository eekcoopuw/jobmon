Jobmon
######

Jobmon is a Scientific Workflow Management system developed at IHME specifically for the
institute's needs. It is developed and maintained by IHME's Scientific Computing team.
Jobmon aims to reduce human pain by providing:

- An easy to use Python API and R API.
- Centralized monitoring of jobs, including the jobs' statuses and errors.
- A central SQL database with all information on past, current, and future runs.
- Automatic retries to protect against random cluster failures.
- Automatic retries following a resource failure, e.g. re-running a job with increased memory.
- Whole-of-workflow resumes to handle missing data or in-flight code fixes.
- Adds Application structure to what otherwise would be a soup of jobs.
- Fine-grained job dependencies, including for jobs within "job arrays."
- An easy-to-use GUI.

Jobmon was originally developed to augment the Univa Grid Engine (UGE)
and subsequently ported to Slurm when IHME switch from UGE to Slurm.
